Include Excluded Pages will display the page name of an excluded page in the menu when (and only when) the user is on that page.

== Description ==

This plugin came from a request on the Wordpress.org forums (http://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-make-page-visible-in-the-menu-only-if-staying-at-that-page) for the ability to display the title of an excluded page's title in the top menu when on that page. Though the page is excluded and wouldn't have navigation links to the page on the site, there would be ways for the users to get to the pages directly.
